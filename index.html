          <h2>So, what's this site all about then?</h2>
          <p>I’m glad you asked.</p>
          <p>I've created this website to document my web development journey - from WordPress Wrangling to Code Mastery*. I have good experience with implementing WordPress - but generally the sites don't perform well technically without substantial caching due to bloated and inefficient code &#x1F62D; </p>
          <p>This site is a place where I can test the things I learn, and perhaps write about them too. It's a work-in-progress, and essentially a love letter to learning. <a href="projects.html">#watchthisspace</a></p>

          <h3>{ &nbsp;About Me&nbsp; }</h3>
          <p>I live and work in Somerset, England. In my day job, I am Marketing Director for an engineering company - a business that has built its legacy on creative & effective problem solving for industry. </p>
          <p>I have 10+ years experience as a Digital Marketer. I enjoy creating digital platforms & communication strategies that help businesses to expand their reach and grow.</p>
          <p>I am insatiably curious - always learning, never bored.</p>
          <p>Outside of work, my interests include: <br />dressmaking, photography, reading, walking my dog.

          <h3>{ &nbsp;My Goals&nbsp; }</h3>
          <p>I want to master the process of building high-performance web sites that deliver results. I am looking to increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>  
            <ul class="skills">
              <li>HTML</li>
              <li>CSS</li>
              <li>JavaScript</li>
              <li>PHP</li>
              <li>MySQL</li>
              <li>UX Design</li>
              <li>Technical SEO</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At this stage, I’m really just doing this for the pleasure of learning something new, levelling up in some areas, and to satisfy a curiosity to see what I can achieve.</p>
            <p>Let's see where it takes me.</p>
